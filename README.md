# CS360 Game Project 2.0

The Game Project 2.0 is the next feature built upon the 1.0 version. This Unity application provides users with an interactive learning experience. Upon launching the game the user is met with the following options: Play, Continue, Options, or Quit. Gameplay consists of the user going through the everyday actions of a Computer Science major student. The user will wake up and go to classes throughout the day. Classes are where the educational portion of the game comes into play. The user will be taught a computer science course which will provide the user with ten interactive lessons and a quiz at the end of two weeks.

The goals for the Game Project 2.0 include implementing new features that had not been finished in the previous version. Features included in the Game Project 2.0 were:
* Classroom functionality
* Interactive lessons
* Graded quiz at the end of two (in-game) weeks

The main project constraint was time. The team had only one semester to design, develop and implement the features listed above. This project was written in most C# done in Unity. This was another project constraint as the team had to overcome the learning curve of the software while simultaneously making progress towards the completion of the anticipated features.
